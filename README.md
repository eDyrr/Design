### The 3 concerns that are important in most software systems:

#### *Reliability*
the system should perform correctly even when things go wrong, to further this point:
- the application performs the function that the user expected.
- it can tolerate the user making mistakes or using the software in unexpected ways.
- its performace is good enough for the required use case, under the expected load and data volume.
- the system prevents any unautherized access and abuse.

#### *Scalability*
as the system grows both in data volume, traffic volume, there should be reasonable ways to deal with that growth.

#### *Maintainability*
over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and operations, both maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new use cases), and they should all be able to work on it *productively*.


### What to focus on to ease software *Maintainability*

#### *Operability*
make it easy for the operations team to keep the system running smoothly.

#### *Simplicity*
make it easy for new engineers to understand the system, by removing as much complexity as possible from the system.

#### *Evolvability*
make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future, adapting it for unanticipated use cases as requirements change. Also known as *extensibility*, *modifiability*, or *plasticity*.
